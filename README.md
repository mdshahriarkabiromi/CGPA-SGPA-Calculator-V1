Welcome to the **Academic Calculator**, a simple command-line tool to calculate **CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)** and **SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average)** efficiently.

## Features
- Calculate **CGPA** based on multiple semester **SGPA** values.
- Compute **SGPA** using individual course credits and grade points.
- User-friendly **text-based interface**.
- Developed in **C++**.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the code using any C++ compiler (`g++ academic_calculator.cpp -o academic_calculator`).
3. Run the executable (`./academic_calculator`).
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to calculate **CGPA** or **SGPA**.

## Example
