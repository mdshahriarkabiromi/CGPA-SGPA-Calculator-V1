A robust command-line application designed for efficient academic performance calculation, supporting both **CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)** and **SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average)** computations with precision and ease.

## üéØ Overview

The Academic Calculator is a lightweight, cross-platform tool that provides students, educators, and academic institutions with accurate GPA calculations. Built with modern C++ standards, it offers a streamlined interface for processing academic data while maintaining computational accuracy.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Dual Calculation Modes**: Comprehensive support for both CGPA and SGPA calculations
- **Precision Computing**: Accurate floating-point arithmetic for grade point calculations
- **Interactive CLI**: Intuitive command-line interface with guided user input
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems
- **Input Validation**: Robust error handling and input sanitization
- **Lightweight Design**: Minimal system requirements and fast execution

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (GCC 7.0+, Clang 6.0+, or MSVC 2017+)
- Command-line interface access

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/academic-calculator.git
   cd academic-calculator
   ```

2. **Compile the application**
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -O2 academic_calculator.cpp -o academic_calculator
   ```

3. **Execute the program**

   ```

## üìã Usage Guide

### CGPA Calculation

Calculate your cumulative grade point average across multiple semesters:

```
Welcome to the Academic Calculator v1.0

Select calculation type:
1. CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)
2. SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average)

Enter your choice (1/2): 1

=== CGPA Calculation ===
Enter number of completed semesters: 4
Enter SGPA for Semester 1: 3.75
Enter SGPA for Semester 2: 3.82
Enter SGPA for Semester 3: 3.65
Enter SGPA for Semester 4: 3.90

‚úì Calculation Complete
Your CGPA: 3.78
```

### SGPA Calculation

Compute semester GPA based on individual course performance:

```
=== SGPA Calculation ===
Enter total credit hours for semester: 18
Enter number of courses: 5

Course 1:
  Credit hours: 3
  Grade points: 4.0

Course 2:
  Credit hours: 4
  Grade points: 3.7
